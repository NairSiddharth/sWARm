    "This notebook demonstrates comprehensive season projections using **historical ensemble models (2016-2024)** trained on multi-source data to project **2025 performance** across different player archetypes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Featured Player Analysis:\n",
    "- **Aaron Judge**: Peak Elite Player  \n",
    "- **Juan Soto**: Consistent Young Elite Player\n",
    "- **Mike Trout**: Formerly Elite - Declining Player\n",
    "- **Shohei Ohtani**: Two-Way Player (Hitting & Pitching)\n",
    "- **Tarik Skubal**: Ascending Elite Pitcher\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology:\n",
    "1. **Training Phase**: RandomForest + Keras ensemble on historical data (2016-2024)\n",
    "2. **Current Performance**: Calculate WAR/WARP from actual 2025 data using 10 hitter + 6 pitcher features\n",
    "3. **Projection Scenarios**: Project remaining games using 5 regression scenarios (100%, 75%, 50%, 25%, career average)\n",
    "4. **Comprehensive Analysis**: Show current + projected + full season totals with player archetype insights\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Validations:\n",
    "- **Two-Way Player Functionality**: Ohtani analyzed as both hitter and pitcher\n",
    "- **Feature Compatibility**: Exact 10 hitter + 6 pitcher features from backend improvements  \n",
    "- **Multi-Source Training**: Baseball Prospectus WARP + FanGraphs WAR ensemble models\n",
    "- **Player Archetype Coverage**: Elite, declining, ascending, and two-way players"
