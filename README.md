# sWARm: (Sid) Wins Above Replacement Metric

Welcome to **sWARm**, a personalized reimplementation of the Wins Above Replacement (WAR) metric in baseball analytics. This project aims to provide a fresh perspective on evaluating player value by calculating the number of wins a player contributes to their team above a replacement-level player.

## ‚öæ What is WAR?

**Wins Above Replacement (WAR)** is a sabermetric statistic that quantifies a player's total contributions to their team in terms of wins. It combines various aspects of a player's performance, including batting, baserunning, fielding, and pitching, to estimate how many more wins a player is worth compared to a replacement-level player‚Äîsomeone readily available to any team at minimal cost.

WAR is widely used for player evaluation and comparison across different eras and positions. However, different organizations have developed their own versions of WAR, leading to variations in calculations and interpretations.

## üß™ About sWARm

**sWARm** stands for **Sid Wins Above Replace Metric**, reflecting my personal approach to calculating WAR. While it draws inspiration from existing models like FanGraphs' fWAR and Baseball Reference's bWAR, sWARm introduces unique methodologies and adjustments to better capture player value.

Key features of sWARm include:

* **Personalized Adjustments**: Tailored modifications to standard WAR calculations based on my analysis and insights.
* **Comprehensive Metrics**: Integration of various performance metrics to provide a holistic view of player contributions.
* **Open Source**: Transparent and accessible codebase for collaboration and further development.
